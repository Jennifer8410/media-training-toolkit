# On-Camera Prep Checklist

## Before the interview (24–48 hrs)
- Define the goal: what do you want the audience to think/do?
- Identify 3 key messages (short, plain language)
- Collect 2–3 proof points (data, story, example)
- List 5 likely hard questions + your bridges
- Confirm format + timing + audience (live/taped, length, tone)

## Day-of (60 minutes)
- Say your core message out loud 10 times
- Tighten answers to 20–40 seconds each
- Pick 1 story that supports your message
- Decide your “no-go” topics + how you’ll pivot
- Wardrobe check (solid colors, no busy patterns)

## During
- Answer → bridge → message → proof
- Speak in short sentences; pause on purpose
- If you don’t know, say what you do know and what you’ll do next

## After
- Write 3 “best quotes” you said (for reuse)
- Note what worked / what to tighten next time
